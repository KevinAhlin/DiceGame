# DiceGame
First time building a proper project.

This project uses simple Java OOP to play a game of dice.
It does that by having the user choose how many player are in the game, how many rounds there're going to play and how many times each players is gonna throw during each round. Every round consist of every player throws a die a chosen number of times and adds up the results. The player who ends up with the largest sum wins that round. If two or more players gets the highest sum, those players both get a win.
